## What are web feeds?

[Web feeds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_feed) allow you to follow a website or blog. RSS feeds are the most well-known standard for this, but there are other formats as well, such as Atom feeds and JSON feeds. With a feed reader app, you can subscribe to different web feeds, get notified when there are new posts, read posts of course, and personalize how content is displayed in a way that's comfortable for you. There are many different feed reader apps out there, and some are desktop apps while others are mobile apps or web apps.
