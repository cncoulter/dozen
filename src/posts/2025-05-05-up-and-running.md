I am excited to say Dozen is complete and ready to fork.

Dozen is a simple starter website for the [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) (11ty) static site generator. It is my great hope that this site gets used to spin off at least a dozen other websites.

Eleventy is a powerful tool and a joy to use. Static site generators like Eleventy are a delight. I love being able to author every line of code on my site and benefit from the efficiency of templating languages like Liquid and Nunjucks. I've previously used and appreciated the static site generator [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), but Eleventy has won me over with it's greater flexibility and stronger capabilities for integrating and handling data. (Also, [Eleventy's image plugin](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/image/) is an awesome powerhouse.)

I made Dozen as a personal project, a way for me to learn how things work in Eleventy and set up a skeleton that I can quickly build upon for future projects. I hope others can find it helpful too, either as a starter project that they can fork or simply as a recipe book showcasing how you can structure sites with Eleventy.

Some of the features on this site are not common on other Eleventy sites I've reviewed. For example, it's easy to set up tags in Eleventy, but it's more complicated to set up both tags and categories. Likewise, many of the Eleventy starter projects I've looked at didn't support multiple authors, and that's a feature I've implemented here in Dozen.

Please refer to the [About page](/about/) for more details on how I've structured Dozen and how you can make use of it.

I'd love to know if you find this project helpful or if there's anything confusing about this project that I can help clarify. And if you make any websites forked from Dozen, please share them with me! I have the modest ambition that Dozen can be used as the base for at least a dozen websites, and I'd love to see that come true!
